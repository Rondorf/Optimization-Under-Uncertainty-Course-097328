## Optimization Under Uncertainty course - 097328 @ Technion IE&M faculty 

This repo contains the assignments of the course and their solutions, using PICOS as interface for optimization in Python. The assignments cover the following topics:
- Assignment 1:
  - Robust optimization (RO) for different uncertainty sets (e.g. ![eqaution](http://www.sciweavers.org/download/Tex2Img_1562706343.jpg)), applied to the Min-Cost-Flow problem (MCFP).
  
- Assignment 2:
  - Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for different ambiguity sets (e.g. moment-based, 1-Wasserstein and SRO), applied to Product Mix problem.
